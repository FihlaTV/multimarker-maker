## Overview
Multimarkers are a dependable Augmented Reality target but can be a bit clumsy to generate. While very much in early development, this web-based tool is both touch-friendly and easy to use. It will generate both a printable PDF of your multimarker _and_ a .dat file for use in creating your app or [Unity](https://artoolkit.org/documentation/doku.php?id=6_Unity:unity_getting_started) project.
